# Microarray-Data-Analysis
The primary goal of this project is microarray data analysis.
This Data is published in 2012 by Staege MS et al. it contains Gene expression in pediatric Common ALL (cALL), and they analyzed
expression patterns of 25 pediatric cALL samples by use of high-density DNA microarrays HG-U133A.
And they compared it to sorted B cells from cord blood of healthy donors expressing CD19 and CD10 surface antigen.
We accessed The data  from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)
